## Overview

Library-Management-System is a comprehensive full-stack web application that allows users to manage, upload, and access textbooks in an academic environment. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this platform is designed to help students and educators easily share study materials and textbooks through a secure, payment-integrated marketplace.

The application features a streamlined workflow for textbook uploads with academic parameter filtering (syllabus scheme, college, department, semester, and subject), secure payment integration via Stripe for viewing or downloading files, and JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions. The system supports multiple file formats and includes an integrated PDF viewer for seamless content access.

### Why Library-Management-System?

This project addresses the common challenges in academic resource sharing and helps educational institutions build efficient digital libraries. The core features include:

üîê **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based user registration and login system with secure session management

üìö **Textbook Upload System**: Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX) with 10MB file size limit

üîç **Advanced Filtering**: Search textbooks by syllabus scheme, college, department, semester, and subject

üí≥ **Payment Integration**: Stripe-powered payment system with dual pricing (view vs download)

üìñ **Integrated PDF Viewer**: Preview textbooks directly in the browser without downloads

üóÇÔ∏è **File Management**: Multer-based file handling with secure storage and retrieval

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (Node.js v14 or higher)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Database**: MongoDB (local instance or cloud deployment)
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe API keys
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js

### Installation

Build Library-Management-System from source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tdsrusti/Library-Management-System.git
   cd Library-Management-System
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../src
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_api_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
   PORT=5000
   MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
   ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=pdf,doc,docx,ppt,pptx
   ```

## Usage

This is a MERN stack application with separate frontend and backend servers.

### Running the Backend

From the backend directory, start the Express server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will start on port 5000 and connect to MongoDB.

### Running the Frontend

From the frontend directory (src), start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The React application will run on port 3000 and use React Router for navigation.

### Application Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: New users register and existing users sign in securely
2. **Browse Textbooks**: Search and filter textbooks using academic parameters
3. **Upload Textbooks**: Users can upload textbooks when resources are unavailable
4. **Payment Process**: Choose between viewing (lower cost) or downloading (higher cost)
5. **Content Access**: View textbooks in integrated PDF viewer or download after payment
